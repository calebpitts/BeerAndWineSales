# BeerAndWineSales
Forecasting beer and wine sales using Facebook's Prophet library.

Data has monthly sales data from Jan 1, 1992 to Dec 1, 2018. 

Typically, I would use an ARIMA model, but this time I wanted to 
test Facebook's prophet library to see how well it worked. It 
turns out that its really easy to use and I really like its 
cross validation function because it makes it alot faster to 
validate my models. I will definetely consider using this when
forecasting time series data in the future.
